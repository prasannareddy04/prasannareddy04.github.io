### **Table: `seats`**

This table will simply track the status of each seat (whether it's available or booked).

| Column Name   | Data Type   | Description                                  |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `seat_id`     | `INT` (PK)  | Unique ID for each seat.                     |
| `seat_number` | `INT`       | The seat number (1 to 80).                   |
| `is_available`| `BOOLEAN`   | `TRUE` if the seat is available, `FALSE` if booked. |

### **SQL to Create the Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE seats (
    seat_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    seat_number INT NOT NULL,
    is_available BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);
```

### Explanation:
1. **`seat_id`**: Each seat has a unique ID.
2. **`seat_number`**: This represents the seat number (1 through 80, as in code).
3. **`is_available`**: A boolean field representing if the seat is available (`TRUE`) or booked (`FALSE`).

### How It Fits:

- The code tracks seat availability by toggling whether a seat is booked or available.
- we are managing the seat booking with `localStorage` in the code, but if we wanted to implement a persistent server-side solution (like in a database), this table structure would serve that purpose.
- The `bookSeats` function in code is responsible for finding and booking seats. When a seat is booked, the corresponding row in this table would be updated to set `is_available` to `FALSE` for the booked seats.
